# Flutter Workmanager
[![pub package](https://img.shields.io/pub/v/workmanager.svg)](https://pub.dartlang.org/packages/workmanager)

Flutter WorkManager is a wrapper around [Android's WorkManager](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/workmanager), with support for [iOS' performFetchWithCompletionHandler](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uiapplicationdelegate/1623125-application), effectively enabling headless execution of Dart code without the need of a running app (i.e. in background).

This is especially useful to run periodic tasks, such as fetching remote data on a regular basis.

# Installation

```
dependencies:
  workmanager: ^0.0.6
```
```
flutter pub get
```
```
import 'package:workmanager/workmanager.dart';
```

# User guide

See sample folder for a complete working example.

Before registering any task, the WorkManager plugin must be initialized.

```
//Provide a top level function or static function.
//This function will be called by Android and will return the value you provided when you registered the task.
//See below
void callbackDispatcher() {
  Workmanager.executeTask((echoValue) {
    print("Native echoed: $echoValue");
    return Future.value(true);
  });
}

Workmanager.initialize(
    callbackDispatcher, // The top level function, aka Flutter entry point
    isInDebugMode: true // If enabled it will post a notificiation whenever the task is running. Handy for debugging tasks
)
```

> The `callbackDispatcher` needs to be either a static function or a top level function to be accessible as a Flutter entry point. 

## Android usage

Two kinds of background tasks can be registered :
- **One off task** : runs only once
- **Periodic tasks** : runs indefinitely on a regular basis

```
// One off task registration
Workmanager.registerOneOffTask(
    "1", 
    "simpleTask"
);

// Periodic task registration
Workmanager.registerPeriodicTask(
    "2", 
    "simplePeriodicTask", 
    frequency: Duration(hours: 1), //When no frequency is provided the default 15 minutes is set.
)
```

Each task must have a **unique name** ; this allows cancellation of a started task.  
The second parameter is the `String` that will be sent to your `callbackDispatcher` function, indicating the task's *type*.  

### Customisation
Not every `Android WorkManager` feature is ported.

#### Tagging

You can set the optional `tag` property.  
Handy for cancellation by `tag`.  
This is different from the unique name in that you can group multiple tasks under one tag.  

```
Workmanager.registerOneOffTask("1", "simpleTask", tag: "tag");
```

#### Existing Work Policy

Indicates the desired behaviour when the same task is scheduled more than once.  
The default is `KEEP`

```
Workmanager.registerOneOffTask("1", "simpleTask", existingWorkPolicy: ExistingWorkPolicy.append);
```

#### Initial Delay

Indicates how along a task should waitbefore its first run.

```
Workmanager.registerOneOffTask("1", "simpleTask", initialDelay: Duration(seconds: 10));
```

#### Constraints

> Not all constraints are mapped.

```
Workmanager.registerOneOffTask(
    "1", 
    "simpleTask", 
    constraints: WorkManagerConstraintConfig(
        networkType: NetworkType.connected,
        requiresBatteryNotLow: true,
        requiresCharging: true,
        requiresDeviceIdle: true,
        requiresStorageNotLow: true
    )
);
```

#### BackoffPolicy
Indicates the waiting strategy upon task failure.  
The default is `BackoffPolicy.exponential`.    
You can also specify the delay. 

```
Workmanager.registerOneOffTask("1", "simpleTask", backoffPolicy: BackoffPolicy.exponential, backoffPolicyDelay: Duration(seconds: 10));
```

### Cancellation

A task can be cancelled in different ways :  
- #### by Tag

Cancels the task that was previously registered using this **Tag**, if any.  

```
Workmanager.cancelByTag("tag");
```

- #### by Unique Name
```
Workmanager.cancelByUniqueName("<MyTask>");
```

- #### cancel all registered tasks

```
Workmanager.cancelAll();
```

## iOS usage

Background task on iOS are very different. Before anything, make sure you've added the following key to your project's `Info.plist :
```
<key>UIBackgroundModes</key>
  <array>
    <string>fetch</string>
  </array>
</key>
```

### Set the application's minimumBackgroundFetchInterval

Set your desired *minimumBackgroundFetchInterval* in your app's delegate's `didFinishLaunchingWithOptions` :

`UIApplication.shared.setMinimumBackgroundFetchInterval(TimeInterval(60 * 15))` every 15 minutes.  

> Note : this time interval is a minimum ; there's no guarantee about how often this will be called. 

### Waiting for iOS to trigger `performFetchWithCompletionHandler`

We don't have any control on how often iOS will allow our app to fetch data in the background. Xcode's Debug > Simulate Background Fetch.

> Currently broken in the latest XCode vX.X.X 

### Add an extra case

In order to know when `Background Fetch` was triggered you should add the `Workmanager.iOSBackgroundTask` case.  

```
void callbackDispatcher() {
  Workmanager.executeTask((task) {
    switch (task) {
      case Workmanager.iOSBackgroundTask:
        stderr.writeln("The iOS background fetch was triggered");
        break;
    }

    return Future.value(true);
  });
}
```
